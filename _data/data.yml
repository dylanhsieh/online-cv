    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
        I am a master’s graduate of the Institute of Computer Science and Information Engineering at Taiwan Normal University,

        my first job was at Openfind Information Technology, where I gained solid programming skills and acquired basic knowledge about Linux,

        and the second job was at Yuan Shi Digital Technology, where I gained skills in web development and started to have experience leading a team,

        currently, I am working at LeadBest Consulting Group, where I have been exposed to more work related to infra setup and have gained more experience leading a team and the ability to communicate with cross-functional teams.

        I will prepare for certification exams to strengthen my knowledge if there still needs to be more areas. I am currently preparing for the Kubernetes exam.

        In my free time, I develop projects related to English learning to help my daughter learn English in the future.

        Thanks for the reading.
